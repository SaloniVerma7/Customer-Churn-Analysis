📊 Customer Churn Analysis

🧩 Description

This project performs an in-depth Customer Churn Analysis using a telecom dataset. The analysis identifies key factors that influence customer retention and churn behavior. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and feature correlation, it reveals which customer demographics and service patterns are most associated with churn.

🎯 Purpose

The goal of this project is to understand why customers leave and provide actionable insights to help the business improve retention.

Objectives:

Analyze demographic and usage patterns related to customer churn.

Identify high-risk customer segments.

Provide data-driven strategies to reduce churn rates and improve customer loyalty.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

pandas — Data cleaning and manipulation

numpy — Statistical analysis

matplotlib, seaborn — Data visualization

scikit-learn — (if included) modeling and prediction

Jupyter Notebook — For interactive exploration and reporting

✨ Features / Highlights

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handled missing and blank values.

Converted categorical variables and binary columns (Yes/No, 0/1).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized churn distribution and demographics (Gender, Senior Citizen, Tenure).

Analyzed service usage and contract type impact on churn.

Key Findings

Overall churn rate: ~26.5%.

Senior citizens and short-tenure customers have the highest churn rate.

Customers with multiple optional services are more loyal.

Visualization

Bar charts, stacked plots, and heatmaps showing churn behavior and trends.

💼 Business Problem

Customer churn is a major challenge in subscription-based industries like telecom. Retaining customers is significantly more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. However, identifying which customers are likely to churn and why is complex without data-driven insights.

💡 Business Impact

This analysis enables organizations to:

Reduce Customer Churn: Identify at-risk customers early and implement targeted retention strategies.

Optimize Marketing Spend: Focus on high-value customer segments more likely to stay.

Enhance Customer Satisfaction: Improve services and support for high-churn demographics.

Drive Profitability: Lower churn directly contributes to long-term revenue stability.

📈 Insights Summary

Churn Rate: ~26.5%

High-Risk Groups: Senior citizens, customers with shorter tenure, and those on month-to-month contracts.

Retention Strategy: Offer loyalty discounts, long-term contract incentives, and better customer support for vulnerable groups.
